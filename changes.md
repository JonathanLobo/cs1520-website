## New Technologies Implemented
* PHP

## Changes
After finishing Part 1, I was quite pleased with the overall functionality and appearance of my website, so I initially focused mainly on fixing many minor bugs. I cleaned up my code by deleting some unnecessary CSS and JavaScript and improving the file tree. I also added a new link to my navbar that scrolls to the contact form. I also fixed a bug in my link scrolling that was incorrectly scrolling the desired location to the center of the window instead of the top. For the form itself, I greatly improved the appearance and functionality of the error handling by adding better styled test and used JavaScript to fade in the errors.

Next, I fixed one of the most noticeable issues with my site, which is that it did not display optimally in all window sizes. To do this, I took advantage of the grid structure from the Materialize framework. When I originally began working on my website, I started from a standard template, but I quickly got rid of the template because I found it too restrictive. The grid structure is what I ended up finding most useful about the framework, because it allowed me to display various elements on the page well in all window sizes by using just a few of the given classes.

Finally, I added PHP functionality. This was the most difficult part for me because I have never worked with PHP before. The main PHP functionality I added was to handle the contact form, connect to the server, and submit the entry to a database. Although I have worked with SQL before, it was never in this way. At my internship at a financial services company, we access the enormous company database of loan application data using SQL, but we donâ€™t have write access to the database so my experience consisted of exclusively select statements. For my website, I was able to write queries to create a database, create a table, and insert data from the $_POST array into the table. I realized that I could improve the functionality by using AJAX to submit the form so that the entire page did not have to reload when a user submits the form.

Overall, this project allowed me to improve my skills at HTML and CSS, but more importantly I learned how to use JavaScript and PHP. I discovered the benefit of a dynamic site with server functionality over just a static site.
